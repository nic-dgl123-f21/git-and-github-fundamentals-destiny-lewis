# Welcome to my First Markdown!

The git and github fundamentals assignment was fairly straight forward, although it had a few usful pointers that I had not known about.

During this mini assignment I learned about:

**Pull Requests**

Pull requests used to be something that confused me, because I didn't realize that in order to make use of them I needed to first create a second branch off of the main branch.
I like how pull requests provide the ability for teammates to assess changes before commiting them to the main branch of the repository. How useful!

**Markdown documents**

While I'm familiar with README documents, I had no idea that the extension '.md' was the markdown extension. This was new to me, and this knowledge helped me to create my first
README!

There was a bit of content within this assignment that caused me a bit of confusion, this content includes *Issues* and *Forks*. They sound like useful tools, however since I've
never had to use them throughout my classes at NIC, I'm unfamiliar with them.
